# Block "My learning"

This plugin was part of Moodle Workplace until version 3.11.

This is a version of the *block_mylearning* plugin for Moodle Workplace 4.0.

It is not included in the distribution of Moodle Workplace 4.0, but it can be
installed manually during or after upgrade from 3.11 to 4.0.

If you were not using this block in Workplace 3.11, we do not recommend to install
it because "My courses" page in Workplace 4.0 already displays courses and programs
overview. This plugin will be supported for bug fixes only.
